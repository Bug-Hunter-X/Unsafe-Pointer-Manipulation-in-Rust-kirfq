This repository showcases a common error in Rust: unsafe pointer manipulation. The `bug.rs` file contains code that directly modifies a vector's data through a raw pointer.  This can easily lead to memory corruption if not handled correctly. The solution, demonstrated in `bugSolution.rs`, highlights the importance of using safe Rust practices whenever possible and explains how to properly handle memory management in situations where unsafe code is truly necessary.
